🎉✨ Celebrate Contributors
---
This is a GitHub Action for celebrating contributors. The workflow collects all of the contributors for the repository it is within. It then creates a table of contributors and a graph of contributions by contributor. All of this will be stored within [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Inspired by: [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)

Created for: [DEV hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-dev-2023-hackathon-4ocn)

🧑‍💻 Usage
---
The Action is configured to be reusable. Please, feel free to use it in your repository!

```yaml

  uses: slouchd/celebrate-contributors/.github/workflows/celebrate-contributors.yml@main
